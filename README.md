# 🎓 Student Portal (Java Console Application)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) activity** I created during my **2nd year in college**.  
It is a **Java console-based Student Portal System** that integrates different academic-related features such as:

- **Registration System** – allows student information input and block section enrollment.  
- **Grading System** – computes final grades based on class standing and exam performance.  
- **GPA Calculator** – calculates a student’s Cumulative GPA (CGPA) across multiple courses.  

The program demonstrates fundamental OOP and programming concepts like **methods, switch-case statements, loops, conditionals, randomization, and user input handling**.

## ⚙️ Features

### 1. Registration System
- Collects student details (Name, Age, Gender, Degree Program, Year Level).  
- Generates a **Student Number** based on year level and random values.  
- Assigns students to a **Block Section**, with available slots randomized.  
- Ensures students can only enroll if the block still has space.  

### 2. Grading System
- Input system for:  
  - Long Quiz 1 & 2  
  - Seat Work 1 & 2  
  - Midterm Exam  
  - Final Exam  
- Grade computation formula:  
  - **60%** Class Standing  
  - **15%** Midterm Exam  
  - **25%** Final Exam  
- Converts raw score into **GPA** using a `switch` statement.  
- Displays **Pass/Fail** status.  

### 3. GPA Calculator
- Input courses and their unit values.  
- Validates GPA entries (only accepts 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 … up to 4.0).  
- Computes and displays the **Cumulative GPA (CGPA)**.
